## Phase Details (Pending Milestone)

### Phase 1024: Fix companion app dark mode — CLOSED

**Status:** Closed 2026-05-08 via quick task [260508-d7k](./quick/260508-d7k-fix-companion-app-dark-mode-switching-th/).

**Root cause:** `applyThemeToChildren_` walker silently skipped widget classes without an explicit `case`. `uilistbox` (TagCatalogPane Row 7 — the tag list) was the visible casualty.

**Fix:** Added 8 widget cases to the walker (`ListBox`, `TextArea`, `CheckBox`, `NumericEditField`, `StateButton`, `ToggleButton`, `RadioButton`, `ButtonGroup`). Regression test asserts dark→light→dark flip across all classes.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.1 (2026-05-08)

### Phase 1025: FastSense hover crosshair + datatip

**Goal:** Add a vertical crosshair line that follows the mouse when hovering over a FastSense plot/widget, with a context datatip window showing the values of all lines at the hovered x position.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.2 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

### Phase 1026: Dashboard time slider preview

**Goal:** Fix the lower dashboard time slider so it shows a preview overlay of all graphed plot lines and detected events across the full time range. Currently the slider track is empty — investigate why the preview rendering isn't happening and restore it.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.3 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

### Phase 1027: Companion detachable log window

**Goal:** In the FastSense Companion app, make the log panel detachable into its own draggable, resizable window — same pop-out pattern as detachable widgets in the main dashboard. Implementation extracts the log strip into a `LogPane` class (mirrors existing pane pattern) with an `Inline`/`Detached`/`Hidden` state machine driven by a top-toolbar dropdown.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.4 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1027-01-create-logpane-class-PLAN.md — extract self-contained `LogPane` class (UI + buffers + filter + theme + DetachRequested event)
- [x] 1027-02-test-logpane-PLAN.md — class-based unit suite covering attach/detach lifecycle, buffer preservation, theme switch, 500-row cap, event firing
- [x] 1027-03-integrate-logpane-companion-PLAN.md — wire `LogPane` into `FastSenseCompanion`, add toolbar `Live` button + `Log:` dropdown, implement `setLogState_` state machine, update theme walker to skip LogPaneRoot
- [x] 1027-04-extend-companion-tests-PLAN.md — add 10 state-machine + Live-button-relocation + theme-while-detached tests to `TestFastSenseCompanion`
- [x] 1027-05-update-walker-test-PLAN.md — add LogPaneRoot skip-rule assertions to `test_companion_apply_theme_walker`


### Phase 1027.1: Independent events/live log detach (gap closure)

**Goal:** Make the events log and the live updates log independently detachable. Phase 1027 detached them as one unit; this phase splits the contract so each log has its own `Inline`/`Detached`/`Hidden` state, its own pop-out icon, its own detached `uifigure`, and its own toolbar dropdown. Inline strip rebalances so the still-inline log fills the row.

**Source:** User feedback after Phase 1027 demo (2026-05-08) — "we have 2 logs right? I want both separately detachable."
**Spec:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-independent-log-detach-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-independent-log-detach-design.md)
**Requirements:** none — CONTEXT.md acceptance criteria are the contract
**Plans:** 8/8 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 1027.1-01-create-events-log-pane-PLAN.md — port events-half of LogPane into self-contained `EventsLogPane` class (Wave 1, parallel-safe)
- [x] 1027.1-02-create-live-log-pane-PLAN.md — port live-half of LogPane into self-contained `LiveLogPane` class with own pop-out icon (Wave 1, parallel-safe)
- [x] 1027.1-03-test-events-log-pane-PLAN.md — class-based unit suite for EventsLogPane (Wave 2, depends on 01)
- [x] 1027.1-04-test-live-log-pane-PLAN.md — class-based unit suite for LiveLogPane (Wave 2, depends on 02)
- [x] 1027.1-05-companion-integration-PLAN.md — heavy: replace LogPane with two panes, two dropdowns, two detached uifigures, parameterized `setLogState_(which, newState)`, `rebalanceLogStrip_()` (Wave 3, depends on 01+02)
- [x] 1027.1-06-delete-old-logpane-PLAN.md — delete `libs/FastSenseCompanion/LogPane.m` and `tests/suite/TestLogPane.m` (Wave 4, depends on 05)
- [x] 1027.1-07-update-companion-tests-PLAN.md — migrate Phase 1027 accessors and add 5 independence tests to `TestFastSenseCompanion` (Wave 4, depends on 05)
- [x] 1027.1-08-update-walker-test-PLAN.md — assert two-panel LogPaneRoot skip-rule in walker test (Wave 4, depends on 05)


### Phase 1028: Tag update perf — MEX + SIMD

**Goal:** Profile and accelerate the tag update path (SensorTag/StateTag/MonitorTag/CompositeTag streaming + recompute). Identify hot spots and replace with C MEX kernels using SIMD (AVX2 / NEON) where it pays off, consistent with existing FastSense MEX patterns.

**Promoted from:** Backlog 999.5 (2026-05-08)
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans
