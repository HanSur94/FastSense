## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Mushroom Cards for Dashboard Engine (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Add Home Assistant-style Mushroom Card widgets to the dashboard engine — minimal, icon-driven cards with clean visual design for sensor status, controls, and quick glance data. Three new widget classes: IconCardWidget, ChipBarWidget, SparklineCardWidget, plus theme additions and full serializer/builder/detach integration.
**Requirements:** [MUSH-01: DashboardTheme InfoColor, MUSH-02: IconCardWidget, MUSH-03: ChipBarWidget, MUSH-04: SparklineCardWidget, MUSH-05: DashboardEngine type registration, MUSH-06: DashboardSerializer integration, MUSH-07: DetachedMirror + DashboardBuilder integration]
**Plans:** 1/4 plans executed

Plans:
- [ ] 999.1-01-PLAN.md — DashboardTheme InfoColor + IconCardWidget implementation
- [ ] 999.1-02-PLAN.md — ChipBarWidget implementation
- [ ] 999.1-03-PLAN.md — SparklineCardWidget implementation
- [x] 999.1-04-PLAN.md — Infrastructure wiring (Engine, Serializer, DetachedMirror, Builder)
